    <h2>CARNIVORES</h2>
    <p>
        Carnivores are animals or plants whose food and energy requirements derive from animal tissues (mainly muscle, fat and other soft tissues) whether through hunting or scavenging
    </p>
    <h3>1.Tiger</h3>
    <p>
        <img alt="pjoto of a Tiger"src="https://wildlifeinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tiger-and-cubs-by-water-768x512.jpg"/>
        The beautiful, striped coat and that powerful, mesmerizing gaze places the tiger among the world’s most revered wildlife. It’s a reverence that’s mixed with a bit of fear, an appropriate reaction to a large, well-muscled, swift hunter with 1- to 2-inch-long canine teeth and 3- to 4-inch-long claws. The tiger is a stalk-and-ambush hunter, and the distinctive stripes are good camouflage in the long grass or wooded forests of their diverse habitats. Dark stripes on a pale background break up the tiger’s outline as it lies in wait for prey to come near. 

Tigers can also be black with tan stripes, all white (albino), or white and tan. The “white tigers” found in some zoos are not albino but rather the white-and-tan color variation with blue eyes (true albinos have pink eyes).

    <h4>2.Lion </h4>
    <img alt="photo of a Lion"src="https://wildlifeinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lion-e1614802417322.jpg"

    <p>
        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

    <h5>3.Arctic Wolves</h5>
    <img alt="photo of a arctic wolf"src="https://wildlifeinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arctic-wolf-768x512.jpg"


    <p>
        
        Arctic wolves, a sub-species of the gray wolf, are pack animals. They live in the Arctic regions of Greenland and North America. Living in the arctic circle, Arctic wolves can live months in the dark and survive sub-zero temperatures. Arctic wolves travel much further than their forest counterparts for food, sometimes not eating for several days. Arctic Wolves live on a diet of smaller animals like Arctic hares and lemmings. They also work together in the pack to take down large animals like musk-oxen and caribou.

    <h6>4.Snow leopards</h6>
    <img alt="photo of a Snow leopard"src="https://wildlifeinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/snow-leopard-768x512.jpg"
    <p>
        Snow leopards are exquisite animals known for their beautiful appearance. Their fur is much thicker than some of the other big cats, to help them stay warm in their cold environment. Snow leopards have evolved to live in some of the harshest conditions, and they’ll eat basically whatever they can find. They hunt boar, deer, hares, and many other medium to small animals.

    <h7>5.Cougar</h7>
    <img alt="photo of a Cougar"src="https://wildlifeinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/puma-mountain-lion-768x512.jpg"/>
    
<p>
    Cougars, also known as a Pumas or mountain lions, live in North and South America. Mountain lions, as their name suggests, prefer rocky canyons and steep mountainous terrain. A single male may keep a territory up to 100 square miles. They eat mainly deer, but also sometimes smaller mammals or even coyotes. If a cougar can not finish its meal in one go, it will hide it under grass and leaves for later.

    </p>
    <h1>OMNIVORES</h1>
    <h2>1.Chimpanzee</h2>
    <img alt="photo of a Chimbanzee"src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768-q80/upload/6b/71/44/shutterstock-7037851.jpg"/>
    <P>
        A great ape species, the chimpanzee is an omnivore. It occurs in the forests and savannah of tropical Africa, where it lives in large groups of 15 to 150 members. While fruits are most preferred, chimps also eat other plant parts like leaves, stems, bark, resin, etc. They also supplement their diet with eggs, birds, insects, etc., and even hunt larger prey like red colobus monkeys, infant/juvenile bushbucks, warthogs, baboons, etc. However, animal parts make up only a small portion of the diet of these apes, with females consuming much lesser animal flesh than males.

    <h2>2.Striped Skunk</h2>
    <img alt="photo of a Striped Skunk"src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768-q80/upload/17/72/16/shutterstock-1168924.jpg"/>

    <p>
        This black-and-white striped animal is a perfect example of an omnivore, feeding primarily on insects in summer and small mammals, amphibians, fish, and bird eggs in winter while supplementing its diet with corn and nightshade fruits as well. Striped skunks are found throughout most of North America, from southern Canada to northern Mexico, occupying a variety of habitats like deserts, plains, woodlands, and even urban environments. They are known for spraying an offensive odor as a warning display when threatened.

    <h3>3.Red Fox</h3>
    <img alt="photo of a Red Fox"src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768-q80/upload/39/5c/a0/shutterstock-1047928843.jpg"/>
    
    <p>
        A widely distributed species, the red fox is found across the world, from North America to northern Africa, Europe, temperate Asia, and even Australia, where they were introduced in the 19th century. They occur in a variety of habitats, from the Arctic tundra to deserts and urban systems. Just like their range and habitat, the diet of these foxes is also highly varied. They hunt mice, rabbits, birds, and other animals, feed on carrion and eggs, and even fruits, grains, garbage, and whatever food is available. These omnivorous animals are excellent opportunistic feeders.
    

    </p>
    <h4>4.Raccoon</h4>
    <img alt="photo of a Raccoon"src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768-q80/upload/e5/47/e3/shutterstock-1313894384.jpg"/>
    <p>
        The raccoon is a species native to North America but has also been introduced in other parts of the world, including several European and Asian countries. Raccoons are highly adaptable and hence, are found in a wide range of habitats, including human-dominated locations. They eat almost anything available, from fruits, seeds, and berries to small animals like rodents, insects, birds, fish, and eggs. Plant matter comprises a greater part of their diet, and they also search for food scraps in garbage dumps near human homes.
    </p>
    <h5>5.Wild Boar</h5>
    <img alt="photo of a Wild Boar"src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w768-q80/upload/66/8c/5d/shutterstock-1469145362.jpg"/>
    <p>
        Wild boars have one of the most versatile diets among omnivores. They feed on roots, shoots, fruits, nuts, seeds, and a range of other plant matter. They also feed on a variety of insects, earthworms, fish, rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and of course, carrion. These animals primarily forage for food on the ground or dig into the ground. Wild boars also eat tree bark and mushrooms when regular food becomes scarce. They are often labeled as vermin in agricultural areas as they raid crop fields and eat crops causing economic losses to the farmers.
